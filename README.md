# New Product Launch Simulation

## Overview

This project uses MATLAB to simulate the launch of a new product in the market. The aim is to analyze various aspects of the launch, including expected profit, minimum, average, and maximum profit, demand elasticity, the likelihood of incurring losses, and the price that maximizes profit. The simulations are based on a random variable and use normal and uniform distributions to simulate the degree of uncertainty. 100,000 scenarios are simulated to ensure a good sample size.

## Analyses Conducted

1. **Expected Profit**: Calculates the expected profit based on the expected demand and product price.

2. **Minimum, Average, and Maximum Profit**: Determines the minimum, average, and maximum profit based on Monte Carlo simulations.

3. **Demand Elasticity**: Analyzes the sensitivity of demand to changes in the product price.

4. **Chance of Incurring Losses**: Estimates the probability of profit being negative based on the simulations.

5. **Price that Maximizes Profit**: Identifies the price that maximizes the product's profit.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in MATLAB and consists of a set of scripts and functions to perform the aforementioned analyses. The simulations are executed using Monte Carlo simulation techniques and sensitivity analysis, based on a random variable and normal and uniform distributions. 100,000 events are simulated to ensure a good sample size.
